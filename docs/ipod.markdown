## Sync to iPod

To sync a video to your iPod, follow these steps:

1. Download an MP4 video using [MP4 Downloader](/mp4downloader/).
1. Connect your iPod and open iTunes.
1. Go to *File* **>** *Add File To Library* and locate the file you downloaded.

If this is the first time you are importing an MP4 Downloader video to your iPod, you may need to enable movie syncing by following these steps:

1. Click on your iPod's icon to bring up the iPod's settings.
1. Click on the Movies tab.
1. Make sure that the Sync Movies box is checked.
1. Make sure that the All Movies box is checked.
1. Click Sync.

If you get a message saying that the video won't sync because it is in a format that the iPod doesn't understand, select the video in iTunes, go to the *Advanced* menu, and select *Create iPod or iPhone Version*.

If you have any issues syncing a video to your iPod, please [contact us](../contact.html) and we will be pleased to help.
