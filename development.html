<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Versioning and Release Schedule Terminology</h3>
<p>Each current version of the MP4 Downloader add-on can be placed into one of these categories. After a version graduates to "released" status, a new version forms through nightly development on the master branch. It then works its way up until it is eventually released, and the cycle begins again.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Released versions</strong></li>
    <li title="These are not unreleased versions. They're PRE-release versions."><!-- Because "unreleased" almost makes it seem like we're hiding it from the public - which we're not. -->Pre-release versions
        <ul>
            <li><strong title="NOT released beta versions - that's just an oxymoron.">Beta versions</strong> in the <a href="firefox/beta.html">beta channel</a></li>
            <li><strong>Nightly builds</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built from the latest source code on the git master branch</li>
                    <li>"Nightly development" is the name for the type of source code development that occurs on the master branch</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Pre-release Versions</h4>
<p>Any MP4 Downloader version that is not yet released (ie. not the version available for download on the <a href="firefox/">download page</a>) is considered a "pre-release" version. There are two types of pre-release versions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <a href="firefox/beta.html">beta channel</a> always hosts the latest beta version of MP4 Downloader. Beta versions are considered stable enough for general testing, but not yet stable enough for a public release.</li>
    <li><a href="firefox/nightly.html">Nightly builds</a> are automatically-generated MP4 Downloader builds based on the very latest source code in the master branch (below). These builds have no guarantees of stability - code in a nightly build can be completely untested.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version Numbers</h3>
<p>The version numbers for the MP4 Downloader add-on, starting with the release of MP4 Downloader 2.0.0:</p>
<ul>
    <li>MP4 Downloader version numbers follow a <code>supermajor.major.minor</code> pattern:
        <ul>
            <li><code>supermajor</code>: This number hardly ever changes - only really major updates with significant code changes merit a bump of the "supermajor" number.</li>
            <li><code>major</code>: This number is incremented with each new release based on the <em>trunk branch</em>.</li>
            <li><code>minor</code>: This number is incremented with each new release based on the <em>previous release's codebase</em> to fix a bug with the release ("minor release"). No new features are introduced.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Version numbers for pre-release source code on the master branch are in the form of <code>0.0pre</code> where the first number is the supermajor version number and the second number is the major version number (based on the version that the code will eventually become when it is released).</li>
    <li>Version numbers for beta versions are in the form of <code>0.0b0</code> where the first number is the supermajor version number, the second number is the major version number, and the third number is the beta release (first beta is "1", second is "2", etc.).</li>
    <li>Occasionally, beta versions may have a version number in the form of <code>0.0rc</code> if it is exactly the same as the currently released version (ie. no new beta version has been published since the last release).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Git Branching and Tagging</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All nightly development is done on in the "master" branch (or other branches intended to be merged into master once their changes are complete).</li>
    <li>When the master branch is ready for a release, it is tagged with the new version number (<code>v0.0</code> where the first number is the supermajor version number and the second number is the major version number). Likewise, beta versions are tagged similarly as well (<code>v0.0b0</code> - explanation above).</li>
    <li>When a bugfix is needed on a released version of MP4 Downloader, a new branch is created based on the tag that was assigned to that version's codebase. The new branch is named something like <code>2.1.x</code> (based on major release "2.1" or tag "v2.1"). We would just keep that branch there, making a new tag inside it for each new minor release based on "v2.1". When a new major version is released (ie. "v2.2"), that branch can be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2343746">deleted</a> - any new bugfixes will go on in a new branch based on the new major version.</li>
</ul>
