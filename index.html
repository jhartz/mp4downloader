<h2><img src="http://mp4downloader.mozdev.org/button_real.png" style="float: right;">About</h2>
<p>MP4 Downloader is a simple, cross-platform, open-source browser add-on that downloads videos from YouTube, Dailymotion, Facebook Video, and Vimeo as MP4 files. This add-on can currently run in Mozilla Firefox (as an add-on) or in any browser as a bookmarklet.</p>
<p>A good reason to download videos in the MP4 format is that this format is iPod-compatible without additional conversion. All videos downloaded using MP4 Downloader can be easily transferred to an iPod (or almost any other portable device). See the <a href="docs/ipod.html">Sync to iPod</a> page for details.</p>
