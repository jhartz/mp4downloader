This add-on was originally created to download MP4 videos (compatible with the iPod) from YouTube. Since then, MP4 Downloader's downloading ability has expanded to include other sites (see below). Additionally, this add-on optionally supports downloading high-quality videos from supported sites that offer them.

A few things to understand:

- MP4 Downloader supports [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/), and [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/) (the "supported sites"). Any mention of a "supported video" means a video hosted on one of these sites.
- A "video page" is a web page on one of the supported sites that plays a video.
- An "embedded video" is a video from one of the supported sites that is embedded inside a different web page that is not actually part of the supported site (have you ever seen a YouTube video embedded inside a web page that was definitely not YouTube? As an example, [this page](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20097156-37/the-charisma-of-steve-jobs-video-roundup/) has many YouTube videos embedded inside the article).

There are a few ways to download videos:

<dl>
    <dt>Use the toolbar button</dt>
    <dd>The MP4 Downloader toolbar button should be on your toolbar. (You can move or hide it by right-clicking on the button and selecting <em>Customize</em>.) Click the toolbar button while on any video page (including a YouTube user channel in addition to normal YouTube video pages) to download the video.</dd>
    
    <dt>Use the context menu</dt>
    <dd>You can use the context menu (the menu that appears when you right-click on a web page) to download videos. Just right-click on a supported video page and select <em>Download Video as MP4</em>. (NOTE: Due to a limitation in Adobe Flash, you can't right-click on the actual video - just right-click on the space around the video.)</dd>
    
    <dt>Use the button embedded inside a video page</dt>
    <dd>By default, a download button is automatically embedded inside the video page of any supported video. Just click this button to download the video! (If you cannot find the button, look for a "Download" button below the video on YouTube and Dailymotion or a "Download Video as MP4" button below the video on Vimeo.)</dd>
    
    <dt>Use the download button placed below embedded videos in web pages</dt>
    <dd>MP4 Downloader has an amazing feature that enables you to download YouTube, Dailymotion, and Vimeo videos that are embedded inside web pages. Just visit a web page with a supported video embedded inside it and click the <em>Download Video as MP4</em> button below the video. If you see an embedded video that doesn't have a <em>Download Video as MP4</em> button below it, try clicking the MP4 Downloader toolbar button to re-check for embedded videos.</dd>
    
    <dt>Use the context menu of links pointing to video pages</dt>
    <dd>If you find a link to a video page on a supported site that contains a video you want to download, just right-click on the link and select <em>Download Link as MP4</em>.</dd>
</dl>

Also, MP4 Downloader allows you to customize other options in the options dialog. More details on configuring MP4 Downloader can be found [here](/mp4downloader/docs/preferences.html).
