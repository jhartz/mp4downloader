### Version 1.3.3 (beta) for Firefox

Since this is a beta/nightly version of MP4 Downloader, it would help us a lot if you could test some of these new features and bug fixes (especially the new Selective Content Replacement variables, compatibility with HTTPS Everywhere, and general video downloading from all supported sites) and [contact us](/mp4downloader/contact.html) with your results.
