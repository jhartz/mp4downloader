        <h2>Nightly Builds</h2>
        
        <p>If you would like to try out MP4 Downloader nightly builds based on the latest source code in the CVS repository, you can download the latest build from: <a href="http://mp4downloader.dyndns.org:1045/nightly/">http://mp4downloader.dyndns.org:1045/nightly/</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since nightly builds are based on the latest CVS source code, they are not guaranteed to be very stable, so if you do find bugs, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> (make sure to specify that you are using a nightly build).</li>
            <li>Nightly builds don't automatically update - you will have to download new nightly builds manually.</li>
        </ul>
